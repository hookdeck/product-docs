## What is a Destination?

The destination component defines the connection to your service. It is composed of two elements:

- A label
- The destination URL _(the endpoint to your service)_

## How it works

Hookdeck uses the endpoint defined in the destination to deliver your webhooks events.

## Create a Destinaton

To create a Destination follow these two steps:

## Edit a Destination

You can edit a Destination by following these two steps:

_Step 1_
![Hookdeck_Update_A_Destination_1](../static/img/webhook-connections/wcDestination/update_a_destination_1.png)

_Step 2_
![Hookdeck_Update_A_Destination_2](../static/img/webhook-connections/wcDestination/update_a_destination_2.png)

:::note
After editing a Destination, it will also update the Destination of linked events.
